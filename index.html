    <p><!-- This stuff is copied from wiki "chocolate" -->
     The word "chocolate" entered the English language from Spanish.[7] <span>How the word</span> came into Spanish is less certain, and there are competing explanations. Perhaps the most cited explanation is that "chocolate" comes from Nahuatl, the language of the Aztecs, from the word chocolātl, which many sources say derived from xocolātl [ʃokolaːtɬ], combining xococ, sour or bitter, and ātl, water or drink.[7] However, as William Bright noted,[8] the word "chocolatl" does not occur in central Mexican colonial sources, making this an unlikely derivation. Santamaria[9] gives a derivation from the Yucatec Maya word chokol meaning hot, and the Nahuatl atl meaning water. Sophie and Michael D. Coe agree with this etymology.

Pointing to various sources dating from the time of the Spanish conquest, they identify cacahuatl (cacao water) as the original Nahuatl word for the cold beverage consumed by the Aztecs. Noting that using a word with caca in it to describe a thick brown beverage would not have gone over well with most speakers of Spanish because caca means faeces in Spanish, the Coes suggest that the Spanish colonisers combined the Nahuatl atl with the Yucatec Maya chocol, for, unlike the Aztec, the Maya tended to drink chocolate heated. The Spanish preferred the warm Mayan preparation of the beverage to the cold Aztec one, so the colonisers substituted chocol in place of the culturally unacceptable caca.[10]

More recently, Dakin and Wichmann derive it from another Nahuatl term, chicolatl from eastern Nahuatl, meaning "beaten drink". They derive this term from the word for the frothing stick, chicoli.[11] However, the Coes write that xicalli referred to the gourd out of which the beverage was consumed and that the use of a frothing stick (known as a molinillo) was a product of creolisation between the Spanish and Aztec; the original frothing method used by the indigenous people was simply pouring the drink from a height into another vessel.[10]

  <p>
Chocolate is very sensitive to temperature and humidity. Ideal storage temperatures are between 15 and 17°C (59 and 63°F), with a relative humidity of less than 50%. Various types of "blooming" effects can occur if chocolate is stored or served improperly. Fat bloom is caused by storage temperature fluctuating or exceeding 24°C, while sugar bloom is caused by temperature below 15°C or excess humidity. To distinguish between different types of bloom, one can rub the surface of the chocolate lightly, and if the bloom disappears, it is fat bloom. One can get rid of bloom by retempering the chocolate or using it for any use that requires melting the chocolate.[60]

<a name="dest_1"></a><strong> dest_1 is here </strong>Chocolate is generally stored away from other foods, as it can absorb different aromas. Ideally, chocolates are packed or wrapped, and placed in proper storage with the correct humidity and temperature. Additionally, chocolate is frequently stored in a dark place or protected from light by wrapping paper.

If refrigerated or frozen without containment, chocolate can absorb enough moisture to cause a whitish discoloration, the result of fat or sugar crystals rising to the surface. Moving chocolate from one temperature extreme to another, such as from a refrigerator on a hot day, can result in an oily texture. Although visually unappealing, chocolate suffering from bloom is perfectly safe for consumption.
